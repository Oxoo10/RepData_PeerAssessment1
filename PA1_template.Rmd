```{r setup, echo=TRUE}
# Load necessary libraries
library(ggplot2)
library(dplyr)
```

## Loading and Preprocessing the Data
```{r load-data, echo=TRUE}
# Load the dataset
activity_data <- read.csv("activity.csv", stringsAsFactors = FALSE)

# Convert date column to Date format
activity_data$date <- as.Date(activity_data$date)
```

## What is the Mean Total Number of Steps Taken Per Day?
```{r total-steps, echo=TRUE}
# Summarize total steps per day
steps_per_day <- activity_data %>% group_by(date) %>% summarise(total_steps = sum(steps, na.rm = TRUE))

# Create histogram
hist(steps_per_day$total_steps, breaks=30, col="blue", main="Histogram of Total Steps Per Day",
     xlab="Total Steps", ylab="Frequency")

# Calculate mean and median
mean_steps <- mean(steps_per_day$total_steps, na.rm = TRUE)
median_steps <- median(steps_per_day$total_steps, na.rm = TRUE)

mean_steps
median_steps
```

## What is the Average Daily Activity Pattern?
```{r daily-pattern, echo=TRUE}
# Compute average steps per interval
interval_avg <- activity_data %>% group_by(interval) %>% summarise(avg_steps = mean(steps, na.rm = TRUE))

# Time series plot
plot(interval_avg$interval, interval_avg$avg_steps, type="l", col="red", lwd=2, 
     xlab="5-Minute Interval", ylab="Average Steps", main="Average Daily Activity Pattern")

# Find interval with max steps
max_interval <- interval_avg[which.max(interval_avg$avg_steps), ]
max_interval
```

## Imputing Missing Values
```{r impute-missing, echo=TRUE}
# Count missing values
missing_values <- sum(is.na(activity_data$steps))
missing_values

# Fill missing values with the mean for that interval
activity_data_imputed <- activity_data
for (i in 1:nrow(activity_data_imputed)) {
  if (is.na(activity_data_imputed$steps[i])) {
    activity_data_imputed$steps[i] <- interval_avg$avg_steps[interval_avg$interval == activity_data_imputed$interval[i]]
  }
}

# Recalculate total steps per day after imputation
steps_per_day_imputed <- activity_data_imputed %>% group_by(date) %>% summarise(total_steps = sum(steps))

# Histogram after imputation
hist(steps_per_day_imputed$total_steps, breaks=30, col="green", main="Histogram of Total Steps Per Day (Imputed)",
     xlab="Total Steps", ylab="Frequency")

# Recalculate mean and median
mean_steps_imputed <- mean(steps_per_day_imputed$total_steps)
median_steps_imputed <- median(steps_per_day_imputed$total_steps)

mean_steps_imputed
median_steps_imputed
```

## Are There Differences in Activity Patterns Between Weekdays and Weekends?
```{r weekday-weekend, echo=TRUE}
# Create a new variable for weekday/weekend
activity_data_imputed$day_type <- ifelse(weekdays(activity_data_imputed$date) %in% c("Saturday", "Sunday"), "Weekend", "Weekday")

# Compute average steps per interval by day type
interval_avg_weekend <- activity_data_imputed %>% group_by(interval, day_type) %>% summarise(avg_steps = mean(steps))

# Plot
ggplot(interval_avg_weekend, aes(x=interval, y=avg_steps, color=day_type)) +
  geom_line() +
  facet_wrap(~day_type, ncol=1) +
  labs(title="Activity Patterns: Weekday vs Weekend", x="Interval", y="Average Steps") +
  theme_minimal()
